# Internet of Things before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio Community 2019 or later
  - Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio)
- A running Azure Databricks cluster.
- A work email address that has Power BI enabled, allowing you to create a Power BI account if one does not exist.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 45 minutes

In the Before the hands-on lab exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the hands-on lab section to prepare your environment **before attending** the hands-on lab. Failure to do so will significantly impact your ability to complete the lab within the time allowed.

> **IMPORTANT**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout this lab you will see the word “SUFFIX” as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups**, select **+Add**, then enter the following in the **Create an empty resource group** blade:

   - **Name**: Enter `hands-on-lab-SUFFIX`

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource group location**: Select the region you would like to use for resources in this hands-on lab. Remember this location so you can use it for the other resources you'll provision throughout this lab.

     ![Add Resource group Resource groups is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, +Add is highlighted in the Resource groups blade, and hands-on-lab is entered into the Resource group name box on the Create an empty resource group blade.](media/create-resource-group.png 'Create resource group')

   - Select **Create**.

### Task 2: Setup a lab virtual machine

In this task, you will provision a virtual machine running Visual Studio Community 2019 that you will use as your development machine for this hands-on lab.

> **Note**: Your Azure subscription must have MSDN offers associated with it to provision a new virtual machine with Visual Studio pre-loaded. If your subscription does not meet this requirement, you will need to either create a new VM with the same settings below, but without Visual Studio pre-installed, then install Visual Studio Community 2019, or install it on your own machine.

> **Optional**: If you already have Visual Studio 2019 or greater installed on your machine, you may skip this step.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **+Create a resource**

2. In the **Search the marketplace** textbox, enter `Visual Studio 2019 Latest` and then select it from the suggested options.

3. For the **Select a software plan**, select **Visual Studio 2019 Enterprise on Windows Server 2019 (x64)** from the results, and select **Create**.

   ![In the Visual Studio 2019 Latest resource overview screen, Visual Studio Community 2019 (latest) on Windows Server 2019 (x64) is selected in the Select a software plan drop down list.](./media/create-resource-visual-studio-on-windows-server-2019.png 'Create Windows Server 2019 with Visual Studio Community 2019')

4. Set the following configuration on the **Basics** tab:

   - **Subscription**: Select the same subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource Group**: Select Use existing and select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group.

   - **Virtual machine name**: Enter `LabVM`

   - **Region**: Select the same region you selected for the resource group.

   - **Availability options**: Select **No infrastructure redundancy required**.

   - **Image**: The Visual Studio Community image you selected in the previous step should be listed here.

   - **Size**: Select the **Standard D2 v3** size if it is not already selected.

   - **Username**: Enter `demouser`

   - **Password**: Enter a password that you will remember.

   - **Public inbound ports**: Select **Allow selected ports**.

   - **Selected inbound ports**: Select **RDP (3389)** from the drop down.

     ![Screenshot of the Create virtual machine blade, with fields set to the previously mentioned settings.](media/virtual-machine.png 'Create virtual machine blade')

   - **License Type**: Select **Windows Server** from the drop down.

   - Go to the **Management** tab in **Monitoring** section click on **Disable** for **Boot Diagnostics**

   - Select **Review + create** to move to the next step.
