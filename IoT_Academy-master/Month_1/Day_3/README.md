# Pricing your architecture


Understanding, monitoring and optimizing your costs on Azure can get complex fast, as you grow to use more managed services, more virtual machines, and start provisioning resources automatically or in a self-service model. Azure Cost Calculator is a free cost management tool that can help you estimate your cloud costs for new Azure deployments, or variations of your existing workloads.

In this article, you will learn:

## What is Azure Pricing Calculator

Azure Pricing Calculator is a tool you can use to gain real-time cost estimates for your services. You can customize these estimates with personal configurations for greater accuracy, and can access and modify the estimates through a central dashboard.You can use the calculator, in combination with other resources such as the Azure TCO Calculator, to perform Azure cost optimization.

## Azure Cost Calculator Features

The Azure Cost Calculator provides several capabilities, including:

- See all Azure products and services, with a short description and a link to a product page. Each page has detailed specs and cost estimates.
- Customize services you wish to include per your storage requirements, resource consumption, performance expectations, and budget. As you read about and select services, the calculator caches your selections to ensure that progress is not lost.
- As you select services, you can swap back and forth between product screens and cost estimates. Each service you’ve selected is displayed with a cost breakdown on the estimates page. You can also return to product pages from the estimates screen in case you want to re-evaluate your options.
- If you find that you no longer want a service or want to edit your parameters, you can do so from the Estimate screen.
- Once you’re satisfied with your estimate, you can click Purchase options. You can then either purchase resources directly through the Azure site, via your Microsoft representative, or via a managed service partner.

## How to Use Azure Cost Calculator

Using the Azure Cost Calculator is very straightforward. Below is a brief outline you can use to access and operate the calculator.
1. From the Azure <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/">Pricing</a> page, click on Pricing calculator.

1. Repeat step 3 for **Virtual Machines**, **Stream Analytics**, **Databricks**, **Blob Storage** and **Power BI**
1. Once you’ve added your services, you can see the estimate and provide product specifications in the Saved Estimates tab. 

1. As you add products, you can modify the configuration of each product in your estimate to optimize your costs. You can also see how resources overlap, for example if two Azure services use the same underlying storage or compute services.
1. After you finish, you have the option to Export to Excel, Save, or Share your estimate report. Saved reports remain in the Saved Estimates tab.

# Monitor costs

So, now you have created your cost model and bought resources to implement your architecture. The next question is how do you monitor these costs and make sure you don't exceed your budget while getting optimal performance from all your resources.

### Generate cost reports

To monitor the cost of the workload, use Azure cost tools or custom reports. The reports can be scoped to business units, applications, IT infrastructure shared services, and so on. Make sure that the information is consistently shared with the stakeholders.

Azure provides cost tools that can help track cloud spend and make recommendations.

## Azure TCO Calculator

When evaluating your usage of the Azure cloud, it’s important to consider the total cost of ownership (TCO). TCO is key to understanding the real cost of your projects and measuring your return on investment (ROI). Azure offers a TCO calculator, one of a set of Azure cost management tools, that lets you estimate the cost of migrating your server workloads to Azure and predict your potential savings for existing workloads.

#### What is Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)?
TCO is the cost of a product or service plus any operating costs. You can use TCO to weigh risk against reward when acquiring services, hardware, or applications. TCO calculations are key to strategic procurement and ensuring the greatest possible return on investment (ROI).To calculate TCO, you need to use a variety of tools and processes which can help you assign dollar amounts to intangibles. When calculating TCO for on-premise purchases, you should take into account facility and labor costs. For public clouds, it can be easier to estimate TCO because all aspects of the computing services are provided and priced by the cloud provider. This is where the Azure TCO Calculator comes in.

#### Azure TCO Calculator: What Is it Used For?

For users wishing to adopt cloud services, Azure provides a web-based TCO Calculator. You can use this calculator to estimate the costs of migrating your data and applications to Azure and predict potential savings.

#### How to use TCO Calculator

- Navigate to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/

![](2020-12-24-13-19-54.png)

- Add all your on-premise workloads here and adjust assumptions in the next step
 ![](2020-12-24-13-22-53.png)

- And your savings report is ready to view. Just 3 simple steps to calculate TCO. You can use the TCO calculator to measure ROI yourself or to make a convincing case to move to cloud from on-premises to your colleagues and leadership
